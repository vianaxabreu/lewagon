Debugging is the process of _finding_ and _resolving_ problems in your code. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) puts it, debugging tactics:

> [...] can involve **interactive** debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling.

In this exercise, we will focus on interactive debugging & control flow analysis, which are the basics of debugging.

## The Python Debugger

One great thing about Python is that it comes with a built-in debugger, ready to be used! The documentation has an [extensive article about the `pdb` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) that you should have a look at. We are going to use `ipdb`, a variant of `pdb` which gives you a better developer experience with tab completion, syntax highlighting, etc.

Let's get to the bottom of it right away. In this exercise's folder, you will find a file called `hello.py`, which contains a program. This program has a bug, let's use the Python debugger to find it!

```bash
python hello.py john lennon
```

What is the problem with the output of this program? It seems there is some trouble with the creation of the concatenated full name. Let's try to debug this! Insert the following line just after `def full_name`:

```python
breakpoint() # equivalent to `ipdb.set_trace()`
```

`breakpoint()` will allow us to pause the program at a certain line (it calls `ipdb.set_trace()` under the hood).

Go back to the terminal and run the command again:

```bash
python hello.py john lennon
```

The program will **pause** at the line where you inserted the `breakpoint()`:

```bash
> [...]{{local_path_to("01-Python/01-Programming-Basics/04-Debugging")}}/hello.py(8)full_name()
      7     """returns the full name"""
----> 8     name = f"{first_name.capitalize()}{last_name.capitalize()}"
      9
```

It's time to play with the debugger. From here, you can do two things:

1. Control the flow of the program, tell the debugger to execute the next line, step into a function, or step out of it.
2. Have a look at any variables that have been defined before the current `breakpoint()`. The program is paused, so you can take a closer look at what's going on 'under the hood'.

Type this:

```bash
ipdb> sys.argv
# => ['hello.py', 'john', 'lennon']
```

See how it works? You just asked the debugger to call `sys.argv` and show what is stored inside this list. [`sys.argv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv) is a python **list** containing the command line arguments passed to a Python script. `argv[0]` is always the script's name.

Our problem is that there is a missing space between `John` and `Lennon`, so we would like to have a look at the local variable `name`. Let's type:

```bash
ipdb> name
# => *** NameError: name 'name' is not defined
```

Why do we get this `NameError`? Where have we paused? To check at which line the program is paused, you can type:

```bash
ipdb> ll
#     5 def full_name(first_name, last_name):
#     6     breakpoint()
#     7     """returns the full name"""
# ----> 8     name = f"{first_name.capitalize()}{last_name.capitalize()}"
#     9
#     10     return name
#     11
```

The program stopped **before** the line with the little arrow `->`. This means that the `name` variable has **not yet been assigned**. This is why we get the "`name` is not defined" error. OK, everything is clear now!

We are inside a function. Something useful is to display the argument list of the current function:

```bash
ipdb> args
# => first_name = 'john'
# => last_name = 'lennon'
```

What can we do now? We can ask the debugger to execute the next line with:

```bash
ipdb> next
> [...]{{local_path_to("01-Python/01-Programming-Basics/04-Debugging")}}/hello.py(10)full_name()
      9
---> 10     return name
     11
```

Here we go, the debugger advanced by one line and executed it. You can see where the program is paused now with:

```bash
ipdb> ll
```

See how the little arrow `--->` advanced? Now we can check what's inside the `name` variable:

```bash
ipdb> name
# => 'JohnLennon'
```

That's it! We have identified the error! The interpolation is missing a space.

You can let the program run until the next breakpoint (or until the end if there are no more breakpoints) with:

```bash
ipdb> continue
```

Fix the `full_name` method in `hello.py`, and run the program again. Don't forget to **remove the debugger**! That's something that can be easily forgotten and incorrectly added to a commit. Some teams might want to add a [pre-commit hook](http://blog.keul.it/2013/11/no-more-pdbsettrace-committed-git-pre.html) to prevent this from happening.

## Going Further

The previous section was about understanding the basic commands of the debugger. You can think of it as a DVD player with the following buttons:

- Pause (`breakpoint()` in the source code)
- Next frame (`next`)
- Play (`continue`)

There are many more [debugger commands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands) like `step` or `return`.

## Solving this Challenge

Now that you have learned how to debug faulty code, you can run the tests for this challenge (don't forget to **remove the breakpoint()** first):

```bash
make
```

You can see that the implementation we ask for is a little more complicated. We want the `full_name` method to behave correctly regarding whitespaces when given a missing first name _or_ a missing last name.

 ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: have a look at the [`str.strip([chars])`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip) method.
